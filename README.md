# Week 2 (Overview of Python for DataScience)

## Python for DataScience
• Introduction to Python and its features relevant to data science
• Python libraries commonly used in data science, such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, etc.
• Basic Python data structures and data types used in data science (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
• How to write and execute Python scripts for data analysis tasks.
## Code for Tuple, List, Set and Dictionaries
### Tuples example
fruits_tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape')
print("Fruits in the tuple:", fruits_tuple)
print("First fruit:", fruits_tuple[0])
print("Last fruit:", fruits_tuple[-1])

### Lists example
colors_list = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow']
print("\nColors in the list:", colors_list)
print("First color:", colors_list[0])
print("Last color:", colors_list[-1])
colors_list.append('purple')
print("Colors after adding 'purple':", colors_list)

### Sets example
unique_numbers_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6}
print("\nNumbers in the set:", unique_numbers_set)
unique_numbers_set.add(7)
print("Numbers after adding 7:", unique_numbers_set)

### Dictionaries example
student_scores_dict = {'John': 85, 'Alice': 92, 'Bob': 78, 'Eve': 95}
print("\nStudent scores:", student_scores_dict)
print("Score of Alice:", student_scores_dict['Alice'])

### Adding a new student and score to the dictionary
student_scores_dict['Michael'] = 88
print("Updated student scores:", student_scores_dict)

## Numpy
• Introduction to Numpy and its benefits over standard Python lists for numerical operations
• Numpy arrays and their attributes (shape, size, dimensions)
• Performing basic mathematical operations and element-wise operations with Numpy arrays
• Broadcasting and vectorization in Numpy
• Indexing and slicing Numpy arrays for data selection and manipulation
## Code For Numpy
import numpy as np

### Create a NumPy array
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numpy_array = np.array(data)

### Basic array operations
print("NumPy array:", numpy_array)
print("Shape of the array:", numpy_array.shape)
print("Data type of the array:", numpy_array.dtype)
print("Sum of array elements:", numpy_array.sum())
print("Mean of array elements:", numpy_array.mean())

### Broadcasting with NumPy
numpy_array += 10
print("\nArray after adding 10 to each element:", numpy_array)

### Indexing and slicing
print("\nFirst element:", numpy_array[0])
print("Last element:", numpy_array[-1])
print("Elements from index 1 to 3:", numpy_array[1:4])

### Multi-dimensional array
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print("\n2D NumPy array:")
print(matrix)
print("Shape of the 2D array:", matrix.shape)

### Matrix operations
print("\nTranspose of the matrix:")
print(matrix.T)
print("Matrix multiplication:")
result = np.matmul(matrix, matrix.T)
print(result)

## Data Frames
• Introduction to Pandas and its role in data manipulation and analysis
• Creating data frames from various data sources (CSV files, dictionaries, etc.)
• Basic operations on data frames (selecting columns, filtering data, handling missing values)
• Data aggregation and grouping with Pandas
• Merging, joining, and concatenating data frames

## Codde for Data Frames
import pandas as pd

### Create a dictionary with sample data
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 22, 28],
    'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
}

### Create a Pandas DataFrame from the dictionary
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

### Display the DataFrame
print(df)

# Week 3 (Data Types and Sources)
## Data Types
In data science, various data types are used to represent and handle different kinds of information. Understanding and appropriately managing data types is crucial for performing data analysis and machine learning tasks. Here are some commonly used data types in data science:
### Numeric Types:
Integer (int): Whole numbers without a fractional part (e.g., 1, 100, -5).
Floating-Point (float): Numbers with a fractional part (e.g., 3.14, -0.25, 2.0).
### Text Type:
String (str): Sequences of characters enclosed within single ('') or double quotes ("") (e.g., "hello", 'data science').
### Boolean Type:
Boolean (bool): Represents True or False values, used for logical operations.

### Categorical Types:
Categorical: Represents data with limited and fixed set of values, often used to represent categories (e.g., 'male', 'female').

### DateTime Types:
Date: Represents a date (e.g., 2023-07-28).
Time: Represents a time (e.g., 14:30:00).
DateTime: Represents both date and time (e.g., 2023-07-28 14:30:00).

### Lists:
List: Ordered and mutable sequences of elements of different data types (e.g., [1, 'apple', 3.14, True]).

### Tuples:
Tuple: Similar to lists, but immutable (e.g., (1, 'apple', 3.14, True)).

### Sets:
Set: Unordered collection of unique elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3, 4}).

### Dictionaries:
Dictionary: Collection of key-value pairs, where keys are unique (e.g., {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}).

### Arrays (from NumPy or other libraries):
NumPy Array: Multi-dimensional array with elements of the same data type, widely used in numerical computations.

## Fetching Data From APi
In data science, fetching data from APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) is a common practice to obtain real-time or up-to-date data from various sources. APIs provide a standardized way for different systems to communicate with each other, allowing data retrieval and exchange between different applications or services.

### Identify the API: 
Determine which API provides the data you need. Many websites, services, and platforms offer APIs that allow developers and data scientists to access their data programmatically.

### Authentication: 
Some APIs require authentication to access their data. This can be done using API keys, access tokens, or other forms of authentication methods. You might need to sign up for an account on the API provider's website to obtain the necessary credentials.

### API Documentation: 
Refer to the API documentation to understand the endpoints, parameters, and data format required for making API requests. The documentation typically provides examples of how to make requests using different programming languages, including Python, which is commonly used in data science.

### API Request:
Use Python (or any other programming language) and libraries like requests to make HTTP requests to the API's endpoints. The request can be for specific data, such as weather information, financial data, social media posts, etc.

### Data Processing: 
After receiving the data from the API, you might need to process it to extract relevant information or convert it into a suitable format for analysis. Libraries like Pandas are often used for data manipulation and cleaning.

### Data Analysis:
Once you have the data in the desired format, you can perform data analysis, visualization, and modeling using various data science tools and techniques.

### Examples of APIs commonly used in data science include:

• Financial data APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance API)
• Social media APIs (e.g., Twitter API, Reddit API)
• Weather data APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API)
• Public data APIs (e.g., World Bank API, COVID-19 data APIs)
